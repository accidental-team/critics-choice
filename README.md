Thousands of different games are released every year, most of which you know nothing about. You've probably heard about a dozen of them. Might’ve even played a couple. However, only a select few manage to impact the souls of the players and leave their mark in history.

The main character of this story is game journalist Jason Lee. He is 27 years old, but despite his young age he has already managed to earn respect among colleagues and readers. And when the most anticipated game of recent years called The First of Them - the action-drama by the critically acclaimed developer studio Sneaky Cat about the invasion of aliens - was on it’s way, he was assigned to write a review of this game. Will all the expectations come true or will the players be disappointed?
